> Exciting news! We've launched a new course to help you master this template: [Craft Next Gen UI Libraries for React 18 and Next.js 14](https://www.udemy.com/course/craft-next-gen-ui-libraries-for-react-18-and-nextjs-14/?referralCode=46B8C7845ECCEA99E0EF)

## Features

This template offers the following pre-configured features. Additionally, your repository will automatically be rebranded with the help of workflows and post-install scripts.

âœ… Monorepo powered by Turbo Repo for building, testing, and deploying your library

âœ… Examples with Next.js, Vite, and Remix to showcase how your library can be utilized (Note: Remix is optional due to instability in monorepo setup and folder imports)

âœ… Examples pre-configured for Light/Dark theme based on user preference

âœ… Examples ready to be deployed to Vercel

âœ… Typedoc setup for automatic documentation generation based on tsdoc comments

âœ… Code of Conduct and contributing files, ready for customization

âœ… Prettier and linter configured according to modern best practices (Feel free to add your flavor)

âœ… Recommended VSCode extensions - Prettier and [Kanban board](https://github.com/mayank1513/vscode-extension-trello-kanban-board) for code formatting and project management directly within your IDE

âœ… Powerful code generators - try `yarn plop`

âœ… Test setup with Vitest - A modern and fast testing framework supporting Jest-like APIs

âœ… Workflows to automate testing on every pull-request or code push event

âœ… Workflow to automatically publish and create GitHub releases when you update your library's `package.json` file.

âœ… Workflow to automatically rebrand the entire template based on your repository name. (Upon creating a repository from this template, a setup workflow is triggered to rename `@mayank1513/fork-me` to your repo name and perform other necessary fixes to get you up and running.)

âœ… Plus, this readme file includes a quick checklist for configuring Codecov and other badges, setting up your docs website on GitHub pages, and more. See [Checklist](./TODO.md).

#### Create a library that is

âœ… Fully Treeshakable (import from `@mayank1513/fork-me/client/component`)

âœ… Fully TypeScript Supported

âœ… Leverages the power of React 18 Server components

âœ… Compatible with all React 18 build systems/tools/frameworks

âœ… Documented with [Typedoc](https://react18-tools.github.io/turborepo-template) ([Docs](https://react18-tools.github.io/turborepo-template))

## Getting Started:

This template is based on one of the official Turbo Repo starters but comes with a plethora of additional features specifically designed for developing and publishing JavaScript/TypeScript libraries, especially for React 18.

To get started, simply click on the `"Use this template"` button to create a new repository based on this template. Customize it according to your requirements for your next JavaScript/TypeScript/React/Next.js library or project.

For detailed instructions and a checklist, please refer to [TODO.md](./TODO.md).

## What's Different?

Compared to the default scaffold from create-turbo, this template offers:

- Unit tests with `vitest`
- Build setup with `tsup` and `esbuild-react18-useclient` that supports React Server components out of the box
- **Automatic file generation**
  - Simply run `yarn plop` and follow the prompts to auto-generate your new component with test files and dependency linking, adhering to best practices automatically
- GitHub actions/workflows to auto-publish your package when the version changes
- GitHub action/workflow + pre-install scripts to automatically rebrand your repo on creation

## What's Inside?

### Utilities

This Turborepo template includes pre-configured tools:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- Plop-based code generator for scaffolding new components
- Automatic rebranding of this template to match your repo name

- `eslint-config-custom`: ESLint configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json` files used throughout the monorepo

Each package/example is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
