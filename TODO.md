## Step by Step Instructions and Checklist

- [ ] Star [this repo](https://github.com/react18-tools/turborepo-template/) so that you and others can find it more easily for your next projects. It also helps me understand that people are using this repo so that I can maintain the repo and the documentation well.
- [ ] Craete new GitHub repository using this template.
  - [ ] Click `Use this template` button on top right -> `Create a new repository`
  - [ ] Set your library name as repository name (This template has automation workflows to customize your repo assuming repo name as library name.)
  - [ ] Click `Create repository` and wait for the setup workflow to finish rebranding your repo.
- [ ] Install and setup Node.js and IDE (I prefer VSCode)
- [ ] Install the recommended VSCode extensions - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode), [Trello Kanban](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mayank1513.trello-kanban-task-board)
- [ ] Install dependencies using `pnpm`
  - [ ] If you don't have `pnpm` installed, run `npm i -g pnpm` to install `pnpm` -> run `pnpm setup` to set up `pnpm` for global installations
  - [ ] Run `pnpm i` to install dependencies and `preinstall` script will automatically touch up workflows and create a commit
  - [ ] Run `pnpm i -g turbo` to install `turbo` globally (Sometime due to `TypeScript` and `Plop` version conflicts code generation requires global `turbo`).
  - [ ] Run `turbo gen react-component`, and follow prompts to generate server or client components for your library
    - [ ] Use `snake-case` for your component name - it will be automatically converted to `PascalCase`
    - [ ] Your component and test files will be created in `**/src/client/` or `**/src/server/` directory depending on whether you choose `client` or `server` component
- [ ] run `node scope.js` from the root directory if you want to publish scoped pacckage.
  - [ ] We assumed that your npm user name is same as your GitHub account or organization username.
  - [ ] Please make sure `owner` is set to your <npmjs.com> username before running the above command.
- [ ] Set up `CodeCov`
  - [ ] Visit codecov and setup your repo
  - [ ] Create [repository secret](https://github.com/react18-tools/turborepo-template/settings/secrets/actions) for `CODECOV_TOKEN`
- [ ] Set up `CodeClimate`
  - [ ] Visit CodeClimate and setup your repo
  - [ ] Create [repository secret](https://github.com/react18-tools/turborepo-template/settings/secrets/actions) for `CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID`
  - [ ] add `*.test.*` to ignore patterns on the website
  - [ ] update code climate badge
- [ ] Add `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` to repository secrets to automate publishing package
  - [ ] login to your [`npm` account](https://www.npmjs.com/login) and create automation token
  - [ ] Create a new repository secrets `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN`
- [ ] Update description in `lib/@mayank1513/fork-me/package.json`

- [ ] Push your changes/Create PR and see your library being automatically tested and published
- [ ] Optionally deploy your example(s) to Vercel.
- [ ] Update sponsorship urls.
- [ ] You are most welcome to star this template, contribute, and/or sponsor the `terbo-repo-template` project or my other open-source work
- [ ] You can also fork the [`terbo-repo-template`](https://github.com/react18-tools/turbo-repo-template/fork) and add your package to `packages/shared-ui/src/examples/featured.json`
